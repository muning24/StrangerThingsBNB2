	    	<p class="title">Creel House</p>
	    	<p class="description">The Creel House was the Creel family's short-lived residence in Hawkins, Indiana. It was located on Morehead Street. The house was purchased in the spring of 1959 by the Creel family. However, strange circumstances led Victor, the patriarch, to apparently murder his family there. By the mid-1980s, the infamous house was abandoned, but, in the Upside Down, the house was Vecna's base of operations. In March 1986, the house became the site of the final 'curse' gate, following the near-death experience suffered by Max Mayfield.</p>

				<p class="title">The Upside Down</p>
				<p class="description">The Upside Down is an alternate dimension existing in parallel to the human world. The dimension originally consisted entirely of sprawling mountains and floating rocks, and was home to a race of humanoid predators. Somehow, the Upside Down transformed from its original state and became a perfect copy of the human world, exactly as it existed on November 6, 1983.However, unlike the human world, this new incarnation of the Upside Down was overrun with alien vines, spores and membranes, and completely devoid of human life.</p>

	  		<p class="description">The Rink-O-Mania is a roller-skating rink located in Lenora Hills, California. El took Mike to the skating rink with Will accompanying them. At the rink, Angela and several of her friends conspired to humiliate El. Traumatized, El hid in a storage room, but then emerged and demanded that Angela apologize. Angela refused to apologize and mocked El further, insulting the presumed death of Jim Hopper. Enraged, El grabbed a roller skate from a bystander and struck Angela in the face, causing an injury to her nose. </p>
